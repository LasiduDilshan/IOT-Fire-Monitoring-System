### Directory Overview

1. **1_MQTT Implementation and Testing**  
   This section includes initial implementations of the MQTT protocol, focusing on testing MQTT connections, topic management, and message transfers.

2. **2_Information Transfer with MQTT and HTTP using JSON**  
   Explores data transfer techniques using both MQTT and HTTP protocols, utilizing JSON formatting to facilitate structured and standardized data exchange.

3. **3_The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)**  
   Covers CoAP, a lightweight protocol designed for constrained networks. Includes examples of CoAP requests and responses, and discusses CoAPâ€™s benefits and limitations for IoT.

4. **4_Hardware Implementation of IoT System Components**  
   Focuses on hardware aspects of IoT, demonstrating the setup and integration of components such as sensors and actuators to build a functioning IoT system.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python, relevant IoT libraries (e.g., `paho-mqtt` for MQTT), and any necessary hardware components set up.
2. **Usage**: Navigate to each directory to view specific implementation details and code examples.
